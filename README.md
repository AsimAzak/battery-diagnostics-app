Battery Diagnostics Web App
Overview

This project is a multi-platform web application designed to streamline battery management processes. It enables users to:

    Scan battery lids and extract relevant data via OCR

    Log discharge test variables and evaluate battery health

    Diagnose common failure points based on historical data

    Update and manage battery inventory in real-time

Built with React for a responsive front-end and designed for accessibility on both desktop and mobile browsers.
Features

    Battery Scanning: Upload images of battery lids to extract model and specifications automatically.

    Test Data Upload: Import discharge test results (CSV/Excel) for analysis.

    Diagnostics: Automated evaluation of battery health and status.

    Inventory Management: Track battery stock levels and update status based on test results.

    Multi-platform: Responsive design ensures usability on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

    Scalable Backend: Integrates with cloud-hosted API for OCR and diagnostics processing.

Tech Stack

    Frontend: React, React Router, Tailwind CSS (optional)

    Backend: Python (FastAPI) or Supabase (for OCR and data management)

    OCR Engine: EasyOCR or Tesseract (backend)

    Database: PostgreSQL (via Supabase or other cloud provider)

    Deployment: Frontend on Vercel or Netlify; Backend on cloud provider (AWS, Supabase, etc.)
